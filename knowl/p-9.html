<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">We proceed to describe the contents of our paper. We begin by examining three elementary examples of RISPs in Section <a href="sec-Ex.html" class="internal" title="Section 2: Three examples">Section 2</a>. These examples serve as guides for our general investigations and illustrate most of the features we uncover in a more general setting. In Section <a href="sec-Prelim.html" class="internal" title="Section 3: Preliminaries">Section 3</a> we introduce basic definitions for RIMs and RISPs, record some facts about RIFs and their numerator and denominator polynomials, and discuss iteration of Möbius transformations in the unit disk. Section <a href="sec-main.html" class="internal" title="Section 4: RISP dynamics on the boundary">Section 4</a> contains the main results of our paper. After some preliminary remarks about general RIMs and certain associated essentially \(\mathbb{T}^2\)-symmetric polynomials, we focus on degree \((1,n)\) RISPs. We then introduce and study rotation belts associated with a RISP, strips on which the dynamical actions on fibers are conjugate to rotations, and give an estimate on their number. We investigate how different components of the fixed point set of a RISPs can come together at a singular fixed point, and give criteria for different configurations to be present. The main tool we use is a one-variable polynomial \(Q_{\alpha}\) built from the numerator and denominator polynomials of the first-component map \(\phi\text{.}\) We conclude in <a href="sec-morex.html" class="internal" title="Section 5: Further examples">Section 5</a> by exhibiting further examples of RISPs having more intricate dynamical behavior, and serving as illustrations of our main results.</p>
