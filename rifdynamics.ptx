        <abstract>
                <p>We examine iteration of certain skew-products on the bidisk whose components are rational inner functions, with emphasis on simple maps of the form <m>\Phi(z_1,z_2) = (\phi(z_1,z_2), z_2)</m>. If <m>\phi</m> has degree <m>1</m> in the first variable, the dynamics on each horizontal fiber can be described in terms of Möbius transformations but the global dynamics on the <m>2</m>-torus exhibit some complexity, encoded in terms of certain <m>\mathbb{T}^2</m>-symmetric polynomials. We describe the dynamical behavior of such mappings <m>\Phi</m> and give criteria for different configurations of fixed point curves and rotation belts in terms of zeros of a related one-variable polynomial.</p>

    <section xml:id="sec-Intro"><title>Introduction and overview</title>
   <p> Iteration of a rational function <m>R(z)=\frac{q(z)}{p(z)}</m> on the Riemann sphere, that is, the study 
       <me>z\mapsto R^n(z)=(R\circ R \circ \cdots \circ R)(z) \quad (n=1,2,\ldots)</me> 
       on <m>\mathbb{C}_{\infty}=\mathbb{C}\cup\{\infty\}</m>,
       is a well-known topic in mathematics, discussed in many textbooks (e.g. <xref ref="BearBook, CGBook, MilBook"/>) and illustrated in beautiful computer images. The theory is quite mature, but important new results are still being discovered. The higher-dimensional theory, addressing iteration of polynomial or rational mappings <m>R\colon \mathbb{C}^n\to \mathbb{C}^n</m> is of later date and perhaps less complete. See, for instance, <xref ref="ForSurv,SibSurv, MilBook"/>, and the references therein, for basic overviews of dynamics in several complex variables.</p>

    <p>In a different direction, considering self-maps of special bounded domains in <m>\mathbb{C}^n</m> (the unit disk in the complex plane, the unit <m>n</m>-ball) allows for the study of iteration of functions that are not necessarily defined throughout <m>\mathbb{C}^n</m>, and leads to interesting boundary phenomena not observed in the unbounded setting. An important example in this latter direction is the classical Denjoy-Wolff theorem <xref ref="CGBook"/> concerning fixed points of analytic self-maps of the unit disk; there are many subsequent extensions of the original result to different settings.</p>

    <p>Our investigation concerns the study of the dynamics certain self-maps of the unit bidisk
        <me>\mathbb{D}^2=\{(z_1,z_2)\in \mathbb{C}^2\colon |z_j|\lt 1, j=1,2\}</me>
        and seeks to establish some basic facts about their iteration theory. There are many works addressing iteration of analytic self-maps of the bidisk and higher-dimensional polydisks (see, for instance, the papers <xref ref="Aba98, AG16,C32, F05, H54"/> and the thesis <xref ref="NThesis"/> for some background). Our focus is on obtaining detailed results for a restricted class of rational mappings by using elementary means.</p>

    <p>We say that a mapping of the form
        <me>\Phi\colon \mathbb{D}^2\to \mathbb{D}^2</me>
        <me>(z_1,z_2)\mapsto (\phi_1(z_1,z_2), \phi_2(z_1,z_2))</me>
        is a <term>rational inner mapping</term> (RIM) if each component <m>\phi_j</m> is a <term>rational inner function</term> on <m>\mathbb{D}^2</m>. A rational inner function in turn is an analytic function of the form
        <me>\psi(z_1,z_2)=\frac{q(z_1,z_2)}{p(z_1,z_2)},</me>
        with <m>q,p\in \mathbb{C}[z_1,z_2]</m> and <m>p(z)\neq 0</m> in <m>\mathbb{D}^2</m>, which is bounded in <m>\mathbb{D}^2</m> and has unimodular non-tangential boundary values at almost every point <m>\zeta \in \mathbb{T}^2=\{(\zeta_1, \zeta_2)\in \mathbb{C}^2\colon |\zeta_j|=1, j=1,2\}</m>. We recall the basic fact that <m>\mathbb{T}^2</m> is the <term>distinguished boundary</term> of the bidisk, the subset of the boundary <m>\partial \mathbb{D}^2</m> where most interesting function-theoretic phenomena on <m>\mathbb{D}^2</m> are observed and the maximum modulus principle is supported. By a theorem of Knese <xref ref="Kne15"/>, if <m>\phi_j</m> is rational inner then the boundary values <m>\phi_j^*(\zeta)</m> exist as unimodular numbers at <em>every</em> point of <m>\mathbb{T}^2</m>, and so we can view a rational inner mapping <m>\Phi</m> as inducing a map <m>\Phi\colon \overline{\mathbb{D}^2}\to \overline{\mathbb{D}^2}</m>, with <m>\Phi</m> sending <m>\mathbb{T}^2</m> to <m>\mathbb{T}^2</m>. In the same way, the <m>n</m>th iterate of <m>\Phi</m>
        <me>\Phi^n(z_1,z_2)=(\Phi\circ \Phi\circ\cdots  \circ\Phi)(z_1,z_2)</me>
        can be viewed as a mapping of the closure of the bidisk into itself that fixes the distinguished boundary.</p>

    <p>Iteration of certain classes of rational inner functions on the bidisk and on <m>\mathbb{T}^2</m> has been considered in several papers, for instance in <xref ref="PS08,PR10"/>; see also <xref ref="SBJ17"/> for some applications. In those works, the component maps <m>\phi_j</m> are assumed to be of the special type
        <me>\psi_j(z_1,z_2)=B_{j,1}(z_1)\cdot B_{j,2}(z_2)</me>
        where <m>B_{j,k}</m> are one-variable <term>finite Blaschke products</term>. Recall that these are functions <m>B\colon \mathbb{D}\to\mathbb{D}</m> of the form
        <me>B(z)=e^{i\alpha}z^m\prod_{k=1}^n\frac{z-a_k}{1-\overline{a}_kz},</me>
        where <m>\{a_1,\ldots, a_n\}\subset \mathbb{D}</m>, <m>\alpha\in \mathbb{R}</m>, and <m>m,n\in \mathbb{N}</m>. It is apparent that a finite Blaschke product extends continuously to the unit circle <m>\mathbb{T}</m>, but the dynamics of one-variable Blaschke products nevertheless exhibit complicated features; see for instance <xref ref="MilBook"/> Chapter 15. Similarly, the works <xref ref="PS08,PR10"/> uncover a rich dynamical structure associated with two-dimensional Blaschke products.</p>

   <p> In contrast with one-variable Blaschke products, a general rational inner function <m>\psi=q/p</m> in <m>\mathbb{D}^2</m> can have boundary singularities: these occur at points <m>\tau=(\tau_1,\tau_2)\in \mathbb{T}^2</m> where <m>q(\tau_1,\tau_2)=p(\tau_1,\tau_2)=0</m>, and represent a genuinely new higher-dimensional phenomenon. The function <m>\psi</m> is in general discontinuous at <m>\tau \in \mathbb{T}^2</m>, even though <m>\psi^{*}(\tau)</m> always exists, meaning that a RISP <m>\Phi</m> need not be a continuous self-map of <m>\overline{\mathbb{D}^2}</m>.  This fact will be the source of several interesting phenomena that we observe in this paper.
   </p>

    <p>Apart from some preliminary observations concerning RIMs, we mostly restrict our attention to <term> rational inner skew-products</term> (RISPs). These are rational inner mappings of the special form
        <me>\Phi(z_1,z_2)=(\phi_1(z_1,z_2), \phi_2(z_2)),</me>
        with <m>\phi_1</m> rational inner in <m>\mathbb{D}^2</m>, and <m>\phi_2</m> a rational inner function in one variable, viewed as a function on <m>\mathbb{D}^2</m> in the obvious way. Skew-products have been studied extensively in the polynomial setting, see e.g. <xref ref="J99, PR19"/> and the references therein. In fact, we focus on the very simplest case of skew-mappings
        <men xml:id="eq-RISPdef">
        (z_1,z_2)\mapsto (\phi(z_1,z_2), z_2),
        </men>
        where <m>\phi</m> is a rational inner function in <m>\mathbb{D}^2</m> having <term> bidegree</term> <m>(1,n)</m>, that is, degree <m>1</m> in <m>z_1</m> and degree <m>n\in \mathbb{N}</m> in <m>z_2</m>.  (We drop the subscript in the first component to lighten notation.) Skew-products of the form <xref ref="eq-RISPdef"/> fix horizontal lines so that the main dynamics take place along one-dimensional sets, but even this apparently very simple case gives rise to interesting behavior, as is suggested in the images below. The advantage in working with such low-degree RISPs is that the extremely simple classification of fiber dynamics (discussed below) allows us to focus in detail on the global features of iteration on <m>\mathbb{T}^2</m>. </p>

       <p> We proceed to describe the contents of our paper. We begin by examining three elementary examples of RISPs in Section <xref provisional="sec-Ex"/>. These examples serve as guides for our general investigations and illustrate most of the features we uncover in a more general setting. In Section <xref provisional="sec-Prelim"/> we introduce basic definitions for RIMs and RISPs, record some facts about RIFs and their numerator and denominator polynomials, and discuss iteration of Möbius transformations in the unit disk. Section <xref provisional="se-:main"/> contains the main results of our paper. After some preliminary remarks about general RIMs and certain associated essentially <m>\mathbb{T}^2</m>-symmetric polynomials, we focus on degree <m>(1,n)</m> RISPs. We then introduce and study rotation belts associated with a RISP, strips on which the dynamical actions on fibers are conjugate to rotations, and give an estimate on their number. We investigate how different components of the fixed point set of a RISPs can come together at a singular fixed point, and give criteria for different configurations to be present. The main tool we use is a one-variable polynomial <m>Q_{\alpha}</m> built from the numerator and denominator polynomials of the first-component map <m>\phi</m>. We conclude in <xref provisional="sec:morex"/> by exhibiting further examples of RISPs having more intricate dynamical behavior, and serving as illustrations of our main results.

    <section xml:id="sec-Ex"><title>Three examples</title>


        <p> A fundamental result due to Rudin and Stout (see \cite[Chapter 5]{Rud69}) asserts that any RIF on <m>\mathbb{D}^2</m> can be written as
                <men xml:id="eq-rudin">
                \phi(z)=e^{i\alpha}z_1^{\beta_1}z_ 2^{\beta_2}\frac{\tilde{p}(z)}{p(z)},
                </men>
                where <m>\alpha\in \mathbb{R}</m>, <m>\beta_1,\beta_2 \in \mathbb{N}</m>, the <m>p\in\mathbb{C}[z_1,z_2]</m> has no zeros in <m>\mathbb{D}^2</m>, and <m>\tilde{p}</m> is the
                 <term>reflection</term> of  <m>p</m>, defined as
                <men xml:id="eq-preflection">
                \tilde{p}(z_1,z_2)=z_1^mz_2^n\overline{p\left(\frac{1}{\bar{z}_1},\frac{1}{\bar{z}_2}\right)}.
                </men></p>

        <p>Here the pair <m>(m,n)</m> is the bidegree of <m>p</m>, that is <m>p</m> has degree <m>m</m> in <m>z_1</m> and degree <m>n</m> in <m>z_2</m>. </p>

        <p>This structural result makes examples of rational inner functions particularly easy to construct - all one requires is a polynomial with no zeros in the bidisk. The following such examples can be fruitfully analyzed using elementary means.</p>

        <p>Consider the RISP
                <me>\Phi(z_1,z_2)=\left(-\frac{2z_1z_2-z_1-z_2}{2-z_1-z_2},z_2\right).</me>
                The first component <m>\phi=-\frac{\tilde{p}}{p}</m> is a degree <m>(1,1)</m> RIF having a single singularity at <m>(1,1)</m>. A computation reveals that the boundary value <m>\phi^{*}(1,1)=1</m>, and so <m>(1,1)</m> is a fixed point of 
                <m>\Phi</m>. In fact, we have <m>\Phi(z_1,1)=(1,1)</m>, so the entire line <m>\{z_2=1\}</m> is mapped to <m>(1,1)</m>. 
                 Next, we note that <m>\phi^*(1,z_2)=1</m> and <m>\phi^*(z_2,z_2)=z_2</m> meaning that both the line <m>\{z_1=1\}</m> and the diagonal are comprised of fixed points of <m>\Phi</m>. Solving 
                <m>\phi^{*}(z)=z_1</m>, or more precisely, the equation
                <me>\tilde{p}(z)-z_1p(z)=0,</me>
                confirms that these are all the fixed points of <m>\Phi</m>. </p>

        <p>We now iterate <m>\Phi</m>. We visualize the action of the iterates by viewing the <m>2</m>-torus as <m>[-\pi, \pi]^2</m> and applying <m>\Phi^n</m> to vertical lines of the form <m>\{(a\pi, t_2)\}</m> for several choices of <m>-1\lt a\lt 1</m>. <xref ref="faveplots"/> suggests that the iterates converge as <m>n</m> grows. 
                Using induction, one can show that, for <m>n=1,2,\ldots</m>,
                <me>\Phi^n(z_1,z_2)=\left(-\frac{2^nz_1z_2-z_1-(2^{n}-1)z_2}{2^n-(2^{n}-1)z_1-z_2}, z_2\right).</me>
                Hence, for all <m>(z_1,z_2)\in \overline{\mathbb{D}^2}\setminus \{z_1=1\}</m>, we have
                <me>\Phi^n(z_1,z_2)\to (z_2,z_2)  \quad \textrm{as} \quad n\to \infty.</me>
                This means that each point on the diagonal is attractive on its corresponding horizontal fiber, while points on <m>\{z_1=1\}</m> are repelling fixed points. The special fiber <m>\{z_2=1\}</m> is immediately collapsed into <m>(1,1)</m> by <m>\Phi</m>, explaining the pinched appearance of the images.</p>

       <p> The special role the lines <m>\{z_1=1\}</m> and <m>\{z_2=1\}</m> play here is related to the fact that they are the level sets of <m>\phi</m> corresponding to the non-tangential value <m>\lambda=1</m>, which is attained at the singularity of <m>\phi</m> at <m>(1,1)</m> (see <xref ref="BPS18"/>). This will be discussed in detail below.</p>

        <p>Our next example is
                <me>\Phi(z_1,z_2)=\left(-\frac{3z_1z_2-z_1-z_2-1}{3-z_1-z_2-z_1z_2},z_2\right).</me>
                The first component map <m>\phi=-\frac{\tilde{p}}{p}</m> again has a unique singularity on <m>\mathbb{T}^2</m> at the point <m>(1,1)</m>, with <m>\phi^*(1,1)=1</m>, and since <m>\Phi(z_1,1)=(1,1)</m>, the fiber <m>\{z_2=1\}</m> collapses.  The fixed points of <m>\Phi</m> on the <m>2</m>-torus are determined by <m>\tilde{p}-z_1p=0</m>, and since <m>\tilde{p}-z_1p=-(z_1-1)^2(z_2+1)</m>, the fixed point consists of 
                <m>\{z_1=1\}\cup\{z_2=-1\}</m>, a union of two lines.
        </p>

        <p>Since <m>\phi(z_1,-1)=z_1</m>, we obtain <m>\Phi(z_1,-1)=(z_1,-1)</m>, confirming that all the points on <m>\{z_2=-1\}</m> are fixed. By contrast, all other fibers contain a single fixed point at <m>(1,z_2)</m>. The dynamics of <m>\Phi</m> are shown in Figure 2: we see that when <m>t_2>0</m>, points are attracted to the <m>t_2</m>-axis from the right, and when <m>t_2\lt 0</m>, the fibers are attracted to the axis from the left.  A concrete formula for <m>\lim_{n\to \infty}\Phi</m> is not readily apparent, but a computation shows that
                <me>\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial z_1}(z_1,z_2)=4\frac{(z_2-1)^2}{(3-z_1-z_2-z_1z_2)^2},</me>
                hence <m>\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial z_1}(1,z_2)=1</m>. As we will see later, this confirms that the fixed points on <m>\{(1,\zeta_2)\}</m> are neither attractive nor repelling in this example: they are so-called parabolic fixed points.</p>
        </example>
        <p>These two examples give an indication of the features (the presence of a collapsing fiber, fixed point curves being smooth, convergence to fixed points) present the general <m>(1,n)</m> RISP setting. However, other phenomena do arise, and mixed behavior is possible, as the next example shows.</p>
<!--
        \begin{ex}\label{ex:rot}
        The bidegree <m>(1,1)</m> RISP
        <me>\Phi(z_1,z_2)=\left(\frac{3z_1z_2-z_1-z_2}{3-z_1-z_2},z_2\right)</me>
        has <m>\Phi(1,1)=(1,1)</m> so that <m>(1,1)</m> is again a fixed point, but in this example,
        <me>\phi_1(z_1) = \phi(z_1,1)=\frac{2z_1-1}{2-z_1},</me>
        which is non-constant, meaning that <m>\{z_2=1\}</m> does not collapse into a point under <m>\Phi</m>. In fact, the component <m>\phi</m> does not have a singularity at <m>(1,1)</m> or, indeed, at any point of <m>\mathbb{T}^2</m>. Instead, the points <m>(1,1)</m> and <m>(-1,1)</m> are fixed by <m>\Phi</m>, and since 
        <m>\phi_1'(1)=3</m> and <m>\phi_1'(-1)=\frac{1}{3}</m>, the fixed point <m>(1,1)</m> is repelling while <m>(-1,1)</m> is attracting. 

        We can determine all the fixed points of <m>\Phi</m> on <m>\mathbb{T}^2</m> by solving <m>\tilde{p}(z)-z_1p(z)=0</m> for <m>z_2</m>. We obtain
        <me>z_2=\psi(z_1)=z_1\frac{4-z_1}{4z_1-1},</me>
        and we note that the right-hand side is unimodular for unimodular <m>z_1</m>, so that we again get a curve of fixed points in <m>\mathbb{T}^2</m>. However, <m>\psi</m> is not surjective on <m>\mathbb{T}</m>, meaning that there are <m>z_2</m>-fibers without fixed points; see Figure \ref{rotaplots}(f). For instance, <m>-1</m> is not in the range of <m>\psi</m> on <m>\mathbb{T}</m>, and a computation reveals that <m>\phi(z_1,-1)=-\frac{4z_1-1}{4-z_1}</m> satisfies <m>\phi^2=\mathrm{id}</m>. Thus, the fiber dynamics associated with <m>\Phi^n</m> on <m>\{z_2=-1\}</m> are those of a rational rotation of order <m>2</m>. This is clearly visible when looking at the top of the images in Figure \ref{rotaplots}. Other fibers that do not intersect the fixed point curve experience rotations of different orders.

        This third example has some features in common with the first two, but the dynamics varies in nature across fibers. Together, our examples illustrate the three possible dynamical behaviors of a bidegree <m>(1,n)</m> RISP - attracting/repelling fixed points, so-called parabolic fixed points, and rotations on a <m>z_2</m>-fiber. In the investigation below, we explore how the actions on individual fibers fit together in a global picture of the dynamical behavior of a bidegree <m>(1,n)</m> RISP on <m>\mathbb{T}^2</m>.-->
