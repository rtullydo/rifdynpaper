# Support code for "Iteration of low-degree rational inner skew-products"

These Mathematica notebooks are computational supplements to our study of the dynamics of low-degree RISPS. 

examples.nb contains computations that produce the examples covered in the manuscript, as well as interesting extensions.

risps_from_graphs.nb contains a method for producing new RISPs from the Nevanlinna representation for analytic self-maps of the upper half plane in several variables. See Agler, Tully-Doyle, Young [1] , Pascoe [2], and Bickel, Pascoe, Sola [3] for more on Nevanlinna representations and RIFs.

qalpha_test.nb contains code to work with the polynomial qa.
